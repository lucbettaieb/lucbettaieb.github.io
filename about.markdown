Luc Bettaieb is a robotics engineering leader most recently based in San Francisco California.  He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering with a focus in robotics from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.  His graduate thesis, advised by Dr. Wyatt Newman, surrounded exploring convolutional neural networks for place recognition to be used for coarse robot localization.

He has worked on robotics software systems for the past five years with applications in logistics, delivery, agriculture, and industrial manufacturing.  

His technical interests involve autonomy, on-robot infrastructure, sensor and device drivers, and systems engineering.  He has driven the technical roadmap and led teams of robotics engineers to accomplish product-focused goals.

Outside of work, you can find him adventuring outside enjoying nature as much as possible.  He is passionate about finding both focused and societal solutions to the global climate catastrophe.

He is currently on a sabbatical off of full-time work.  He is not interested in job requests at the moment.
